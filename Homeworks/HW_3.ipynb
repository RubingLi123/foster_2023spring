        "After discussing the churn problem at TelCo with Henrietta for a while (remember, from your pre-class assignment?), you've finally defined an adequate target variable for churn and gathered relevant data to predict it. Moreover, the marketing department has come up with an amazing retention offer: the offer is guaranteed to convince customers to extend their contract for an extra year after receiving it. Unfortunately, the offer is quite expensive; it costs $200. You've been authorized to give the retention offer to up to 25% of the customers whose contracts are expiring. \n",
