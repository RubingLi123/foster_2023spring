You can take a look at the chapters: Preliminaries, Introductory Examples (e.g. \"Counting Time Zones with pandas”), IPython (page 46 to 62) and specially, Pandas--one of the main Python packages for data analysis.  We will work with Pandas in class.\n",

Imagine an author trying to find the perfect paragraph to describe a character. In these situations, I like to go for a walk, listen to some music, or get some exercise. Anything to clear my head. From experience, many seemingly hard programming problems have become solvable only after introducing some fresh perspective, and being stuck while beating your head on the keyboard just isn't fun. "
