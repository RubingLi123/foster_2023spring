        "So far we have been exposed to tree-structured models and logistic regression in class, as well as non-linear methods based on these (like RandomForests and LR with polynomial features). Now, it's time for another popular modeling technique for supervised learning (especially in text classification): Naive Bayes (NB). In particular, we are using a Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BNB) for our binary classification task. (Bernoulli NB is the model described in the book; there are other versions of NB -- see below.)\n",
        "\n",
        "As described in your text, the Naive Bayes model is a **probabilistic approach which assumes conditional independence between features** (in this case, each word/ngram is a feature, the conditioning is on the true class). It assigns class labels (e.g. is_fa_complaint = 1 or is_fa_complaint = 0). In other words, Naive Bayes models the probabilities of the presence of each _word_, given that we have a flight attendant complaint, and given that we do not have a flight attendant complaint.  Then it combines them using Bayes Theorem (again, as described in the book).\n",
